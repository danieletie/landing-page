# landing-page
TOP landing page project
The aim of this project is to complete the TOP landing page project.

Hopefully I get to  exercise more of what I have learnt so far on TOP
despite taking a two month long break :(
The goal here is to put into practice some of the lessons learnt from
the CSS lessons especially, I believe, CSS flexbox properties. And of>
course, any other helpful piece of code I can lay my hand on...


To get started, the following layout and styles where given

Made changes to the css file as the previous version was not responsive.
Viewing on mobile devices were a pain in the behind! Learnt about media 
query CSS rules and put it to use here. Still trying to fully understand the 
concept tbh, but this has worked so far, SO!!!!
