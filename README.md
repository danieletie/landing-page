# landing-page
TOP landing page project
The aim of this project is to complete the TOP landing page project.
Hopefully I get to  exercise more of what I have learnt so far on TOP
despite taking a two month long break :(
The goal here is to put into practice some of the lessons learnt from
the CSS lessons especially, I believe, CSS flexbox properties. And of
course, any other helpful piece of code I can lay my hand on...
